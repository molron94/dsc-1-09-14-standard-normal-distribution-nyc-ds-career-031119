    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, we will introduce a special case of normal distributions called \"The Standard Normal Distribution\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare and contrast the normal and the standard normal distribution\n",
    "* Calculate the z-score (standard score) for an observation from normally distributed data\n",
    "* Understand the process for standardizing data by converting it to the standard normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a standard normal distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we talked about normal (or gaussian) distribution characterized by a bell shape curve. We also identified the mean and standard deviation to be the defining parameters of a normal distribution. As discussed, normal distributions do not necessarily have the same means and standard deviations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution. A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called a standard normal distribution as shown below:\n",
    "<img src = \"snorm2.png\" width = 500>\n",
    "\n",
    "IF we plot a continuous cumulative distribution function as we saw earlier, for a standard normal distrubtion, the cdf would look like this. \n",
    "<img src = \"snorm1.png\" width = 300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking back to the standard deviation rule, since the standard deviation is equal to one, we can say that\n",
    "\n",
    "* 68% of the area lies between +1 and ‐1 sd\n",
    "* 95% of the area lies between +2 and ‐2 sd\n",
    "* 99% of the area lies between +3 and ‐3 sd\n",
    "\n",
    "This is generally referred to as 3-sigma rule, where sigma is the what we call the standard deviation. "

    "## Standard score (z-Score)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard score (more commonly referred to as a z-score) is a very useful statistic because it allows us to:\n",
    "1. Calculate the probability of a score occurring within a given normal distribution and \n",
    "2. Enables comparison between two scores that are from different normal distributions.\n",

    "The standard normal distribution is sometimes called the z distribution. A z score always reflects the number of standard deviations above or below the mean a particular score is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An example \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a person scored a 70 on a test, with results distribution having a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, then they scored 2 standard deviations above the mean. Converting the test scores to z scores, an X of 70 would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### z = (70 - 50) / 10  = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a z score of 2 means the original score was 2 standard deviations above the mean. Note that the z distribution will only be a normal distribution if the original distribution (X) is normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking on these lines, you can also convert a z-score back to a original score (X) by using same formula as:\n",

    "So you see , as we mentioned initially, a standard normal distribution can be a powerful way to analyze observations in terms of their distance from mean and can also identify actual value of an observation - all based on z-score and standard normal distributions. "

For a number of machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques, it is imperative that the the effect of scale of data should be removed first.
